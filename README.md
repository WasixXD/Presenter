# Creating slides üõù

To create a presentation, follow these steps:

1) Create a Markdown File: Start by creating a file with a .md extension. This file will contain the content of your presentation.

2) Structure Your Slides: In the Markdown file, write the content for your slides. Use headings (e.g., # Slide Title) to define each slide's title.

3) Separate Slides: To add more slides, use a separator line made of three underscores (___). This line indicates the end of one slide and the beginning of another.

**Example**

```md
# Slide 1 Title
This is the content for the first slide.

___

# Slide 2 Title
This is the content for the second slide.

___

# Slide 3 Title
This is the content for the third slide.
```
